Hi, the only thing you need to run the script is Python and this library. The links are on the next line.
Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
Library: pip install language-tool-python

For run this script you need to stay in the directory where you copy the file.
Go to the command line and write: python proofread_spanish.py 
and that's it enter your text and click enter!
